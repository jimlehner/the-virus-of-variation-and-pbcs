# The Virus of Variation & Process Behavior Charts: A Guide for the Perplexed
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **The Virus of Variation & Process Behavior Charts: A Guide for the perplexed** [www.brokenquality.com/book](https://www.brokenquality.com/book). Here, you'll find the datasets and code associated with the book organized by chapter. The intent of the repository is to serve as a practical resources for readers interested in furthering their knowledge of variation as it pertains to Python.

## About the book
**The Virus of Variation & Process Behavior Charts** serves as an introduction to understanding variation and the only tool capable of making sense of variation, the process behavior chart (control chart). Broken into five parts, each part builds on the

## About The Broken Quality Initiative
**The Virus of Variation & Process Behavior Charts** is part of a larger body of work called **The Broken Quality Inititiave**. BQI aims to address industries pervasive lack of knowledge of variation and the only tool capable of making sense of variation, the process behavior chart (control chart).

The lack of knowledge of variation is reflected in the often haphazard, disorganized, and chaotic methods that individuals, teams, and organizations use to improve quality and reduce costs. Rather than work to understand and eliminate the sources of variation that make processes unpredictable, inordinate amounts of time and attention are dedicated to gut feelings and guess work. While this sentiment is often accompanied by best efforts and hard work, the lack of theory to guide actions reliably digs the hole deeper.  

Since the mid-1920s, with the seminal work of Dr. Walter Shewhart at Bell Labs, a method and tool capable of making sense of data has been at our fingertips. It is due time that industry put to work what Shewhart discovered more than 100 years ago. It is due time that individuals, teams, and organizations learn to turn data into insights and insights into actions that result in change using process behavior charts.
